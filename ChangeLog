	* HACKING : New rulez.
	* NOTES: Killed.  We have a mailing list now for this kind of stuff.
	* glib/makefile : New, to build the new glib-sharp.dll target.
	* glib/Object.cs : (GetObject): Commented out. Design problems here.
	IntPtr's can't be used in the manner this code attempts to use them.  
	(Data prop): Commented out.  Apparently keyed properties are not 
	supported.  
	(Object prop): Renamed RawObject, and made it protected.
	(Events): Fixed to cause list to be initialized if null and then 
	return the list.
	* glib/ObjectManager.cs : commented out entirely.  Not sure what this
	code is trying to accomplish and it doesn't compile.
	* glib/Value.cs : New attempt at implementing GValues. Doesn't work 
	yet.
	* gtk/Button.cs : Updated to use RawObject.  
	(Clicked event): s/EmitDeleteEvent/EmitClickedEvent.
	(Button(String)): s/gtk_label_new_with_lable/gtk_button_new_with_label.
	* gtk/Label.cs : Fixed some yank and paste errors where 2 value params
	were getting passed to all the set_* property methods.
	* gtk/Window.cs : Fixed hanging GTK namespace ref.
	* sample/HelloWorld.cs : Fixed hanging GTK namespace ref.
