Before beginning work on something, please post your intentions to the 
mailing list (gtk-sharp-list@ximian.com).  Duplication of effort just gets
folks cranky in general.  

Prior to checking anything into CVS, please send a patch to the mailing list
for approval.  Any patches should be submitted in diff -u format.  Also, it is 
assumed that the submitter has verified that the patch does not break the 
build, and hopefully that it doesn't break runtime.
