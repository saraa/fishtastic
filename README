Gtk# is a .NET language binding for the GTK+ toolkit and assorted GNOME
libraries.  Gtk# is free software, licensed under the GNU LGPL.  The target
is the 2.0 platform, and no plans are currently in place to backport to 1.2.

The effort essentially boils down to an exercise in PInvoke against the C
dynamic libraries.  It may end up being slow as hell, but we'll see when we get 
there and adjust accordingly.

Building & Installing Gtk#:
---------------------------

    To compile Gtk# on Win32 using the .Net framework compiler and libraries,
    in the top level directory, type:

    make -f makefile.win32

    The Linux build is the traditional:

        ./configure
        make
        make install

    If you are compiling from CVS, you will need libtool and the auto* tools
    and will need to replace the configure above with autogen.sh.
