The Gtk# homepage can be found at gtk-sharp.sourceforge.net.

Gtk# is a C# binding for the Gtk+ toolkit (www.gtk.org).  The target is the
2.0 platform, and no plans are currently in place to backport to 1.2.

The effort essentially boils down to an exercise in PInvoke against the C
dynamic libraries.  It may end up being slow as hell, but we'll see when we get 
there and adjust accordingly.

Building Gtk#:
--------------
To compile Gtk# on Win32 using the .Net framework compiler and libraries,
in the top level directory, type:

make -f makefile.win32

The linux build is the traditional:

configure
make
make install

If you are compiling from CVS, you will need libtool and the auto* tools
and will need to replace the configure above with autogen.sh.

Discussion:
-----------
A mailing list for Gtk# discussion (gtk-sharp-list@ximian.com) is available.
Subscription and archives are available at lists.ximian.com. The list
requires subscription in order to post.
