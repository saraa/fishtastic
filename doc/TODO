Short-term within the doc scripts:
* Determine why some properties are not listing their types properly.
  (see: introspect.cs:160)
* In introspect.cs, import introspection functions from gobject, use these
  to retrieve things like enum field descriptions
* have makefile.win32 reference the csc-generated docs instead
  of the local copies stored here (since mcs doesn't generate docs)
* generate summary page(s)
 
Short-term within gtksharp/generator/codegen.exe:
* Once struct and boxed field generation is working again,
  generate docs for these fields.

Long-term:
* Per Arneng has written an HTML generator for the ECMA doc format
  that looks very nice. We may want to use this format for stage 1 & 2
  and use his generator instead of the XSLT step.
  The generator is at: http://hus11.rsn.bth.se/~pure/sharpdoc.tar.gz
* Get NDoc working and use that instead:
  * on windows, NDoc breaks because there are no dllimport-compatible
    windows dlls for gtk+/glib/etc.
  * on linux, I'm not even sure if NDoc compiles yet. Also, mcs does
    not generate doc.xml files yet.
