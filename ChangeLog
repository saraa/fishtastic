	reported by David Dawkins.

2001-12-17  Mike Kestner <mkestner@speakeasy.net>

	* makefile : Add the pango subdir.
	* codegen/defs-parse.pl : Add a buttload of type entries to %maptypes
	  and %marshaltypes. Ignore props, sigs, and methods for non GObject 
	  types. Turn on all classes. Major beefup of struct generation. Start
	  to use the new sighandlers. Rip out const- types. Handle Unicode
	  string marshalling. 
	* codegen/gdk-structs.defs : Regenerated.
	* codegen/get-structs-from-source.pl : Handle typedef x y; Suppress

2001-12-11  Mike Kestner <mkestner@speakeasy.net>

	* codegen/get-structs-from-source.pl : New define-struct extractor.
	* codegen/gdk-structs.defs : generated defs with a few hand edits.

2001-12-04  Mike Kestner <mkestner@speakeasy.net>

	* codegen/defs-parse.pl : Index %structs by cname, not name. Derive
	  structs from class to facilitate marshalling since Value types can't
	  use the Marshal.PtrToStructure method. Generate StructLayout attr
	  for struct class defs. Stuff the signal args into a SignalArgs inst
	  to pass to the EventHandlers. 
	* sample/HelloWorld.cs : some cleanup and temporary signal playcode.

2001-12-01  Mike Kestner <mkestner@speakeasy.net>

	* makefile : Make ROOT /cygdrive/, not //.

2001-11-25  Mike Kestner <mkestner@speakeasy.net>

	* codegen/defs-parse.pl (get_sighandler): gen the helper class. arg
	  passing and return value handling need beefing up still.
	* glib/SignalArgs.cs : New arg passing/ return value handling class.
	* glib/SignalCallback.cs (dtor): kill, this will be gen'd in the 
	  subclasses. (ctor): prune down to two params.

2001-11-24  Mike Kestner <mkestner@speakeasy.net>

	* codegen/defs-parse.pl : mkdir the glib/generated dir.
	(gen_signal): Call new get_sighandler sub. Doesn't use the returned
	  value yet.  s/event/ev3nt on arg names.
	(get_sighandler): new sub to lookup or gen a signal helper/delegate.
	  Only generates the delegate so far.
	* codegen/hardcoded.defs : Added a stub for Gdk.Event.
	* gdk/Event.cs : Killed, now a generated struct.
	* gdk/SimpleEvent.cs (SimpleEventCallback): Use Marshal.PtrToStructure
	  to create the Event, not a ctor(IntPtr).
	* glib/SignalCallback.cs : New abstract base class for signal helpers.

2001-11-14  Mike Kestner <mkestner@speakeasy.net>

	* codegen/defs-parse.pl : Add System.Collections to usings. 
	s/event/signal. Add gen_signal sub and call it from gen_object.
	Mangle method names that collide with signal names by prepending
	Emit to the method name.
	* codegen/makefile : add gtk-signals.defs to the build.

2001-11-13  Mike Kestner <mkestner@speakeasy.net>

	* codegen/get-signals-from-source.pl : My own little perl signal 
	parser.  
	* codegen/gtk-signals.defs : Ripped the GtkWindow signals into here
	to goof with.

2001-11-10  Mike Kestner <mkestner@speakeasy.net>

	* codegen/defs-parse.pl : Fix String prop generation code.
	* gtk/Window.custom : Fix ctor param casting error.

2001-11-09  Mike Kestner <mkestner@speakeasy.net>

	* codegen/defs-parse.pl : Use the @ctors list to determine if a class
	is abstract.  There is an abstract indicator in the new defs format
	description, but it doesn't appear in the defs files currently. This
	method should be reliable though, even in the long term. Use the same
	check to determine if ctor(IntPtr obj) should be gen'd.

2001-11-09  Mike Kestner <mkestner@speakeasy.net>

	* codegen/defs-parse.pl : Now genning Window, AccelGroup, Bin, and
	GdkPixbuf classes to peel the csc error onion. Explicitly add GObject
	to the "exists ($objects{...})" branches, since GObject is a hard
	coded Class.

2001-11-08  Mike Kestner <mkestner@speakeasy.net>

	* codegen/defs-parse.pl : Build a structs hash and gen the structs
	after the first pass of the defs.  For structs and functions, mangle
	the 100s of params/fields named object to objekt. Insert using stmnts
	for structs too.
	* codegen/hardcoded.defs : Add GtkAccelEntry struct.

2001-11-07  Mike Kestner <mkestner@speakeasy.net>

	* codegen/defs-parse.pl (gen_object): Insert using statements. Insert 
	class members from corresponding .custom file.  
	* gtk/Window.custom : Renamed file from Window.cs.  Removed all the
	automatically generated members.  This will be the mechanism used to
	improve upon the mechanically generated binding.

2001-11-05  Mike Kestner <mkestner@speakeasy.net>

	* codegen/defs-parse.pl (gen_object): Generate a ctor (IntPtr obj) for
	every object.  This is a wrapper constructor for use by an Object
	manager which will be called by GLib.Object.GetObject eventually to
	wrap raw GObject pointers returned by methods/props.

2001-11-04  Mike Kestner <mkestner@speakeasy.net>

	* codegen/defs-parse.pl : struct generation.  Added float and double
	type mapping entries.
	* codegen/hardcoded.defs : GdkGeometry definition.  define-struct
	doesn't appear to be supported in the current defs files.  This file
	will be used for manual definition of unsupported defs.
	* codegen/makefile : add hardcoded.defs.

2001-11-02  Mike Kestner <mkestner@speakeasy.net>

	* codegen/defs-parse.pl : define-struct detection.  Partial ctor
	support.  Still need to deal with ctor signiature collisions.
	Refactored gen_method to share get_param_strings with ctors.

2001-10-30  Mike Kestner <mkestner@speakeasy.net>

	* codegen/defs-parse.pl : streamline mkdir stuff.  Prune the object
	list back to just Window for now. Suppress generation of the Prop
	get/set accessor methods.
	* codegen/gdk-types.defs : Updated the 2button/3button event types
	since I don't feel like automangling them now.
	* gdk/Event.cs : Killed the now redundant EventType declaration.
	* glib/Object.cs : Override the Equals and GetHashCode methods.

2001-10-25  Mike Kestner <mkestner@speakeasy.net>

	* glib/Object.cs : Added Get|SetProperty methods for Object
	properties.

2001-10-25  Mike Kestner <mkestner@speakeasy.net>

	* codegen/get-props-from-source.pl : Temporary (possibly) defs
	generator for props. Will probably kill this when the official
	defs support props.
	* codegen/defs-parse.pl : Added object-based aggregation of
	defs. Generate the class shells, methods, and props.
	* codegen/gdk-types.defs : ripped from pygtk.
	* codegen/gtk.defs : ripped from pygtk.
	* codegen/gtk-props.defs : some props defs.
	* codegen/makefile : add the new defs files.
	
2001-10-11  Mike Kestner <mkestner@speakeasy.net>

	* makefile : Add the codegen directory
	* codegen/defs-parse.pl : Moved here from topdir and updated to parse
	the new defs format for enums and flags.
	* codegen/gtk-types.defs : Borrowed from pygtk.
	* codegen/makefile : new
	* gtk/makefile : remove generation step.
	* gtk/gtk.defs : removed, now in codegen dir.

2001-10-07  Mike Kestner <mkestner@speakeasy.net>

	* gtk/Button.cs : Some nomenclature changes.  s/EmitClicked/Click, etc.
	We need a consistent way to deal with naming clashes in gtk's method
	and signal namespaces.  When clashes exist, events will be made past
	tense and methods to programatically emit events will be the present 
	tense (e.g. Clicked event and Click method).

2001-10-07  Mike Kestner <mkestner@speakeasy.net>

	* glib/Object.cs : Added public Handle property.  It would be nice
	if I could make the RawObject public for get and protected for set, 
	but that doesn't appear to be possible with C# properties.
	* gtk/Container.cs : New class with 2 of the 3 props and the Add/Remove
	methods only implemented.
	* gtk/Widget.cs : Added SizeRequest prop which is a combination of
	HeightRequest and SizeRequest. Embrace and extend gtk...
	* gtk/Window.cs : Derive from newly added Container subclass.
	* sample/ButtonApp.cs : Simple tire-kicking app.

2001-10-06  Mike Kestner <mkestner@speakeasy.net>

	* gtk/Button.cs : Implemented 3 constructors, 5 methods, 4 properties,
	and 6 signals.  Button API is 100% implemented.  Need to implement
	some Container methods to be able to complete testing.

2001-10-05  Mike Kestner <mkestner@speakeasy.net>

	* defs-parse.pl : A little automation for the binding.  The enums and 
	flags can be painlessly generated from defs files. 
	* gtk/makefile : use defs-parse.pl to produce generated.cs.
	* gtk/.cvsignore : hush generated.cs
	* gtk/gtk.defs : unceremoniously ripped from gtk+ HEAD.
	* gtk/Window.cs : Killed the WindowType enum which is now generated.
	
2001-10-04  Mike Kestner <mkestner@speakeasy.net>

	* glib/SimpleSignal.cs : Reworked to parallel SimpleEvent.

2001-10-04  Mike Kestner <mkestner@speakeasy.net>

	* gtk/Widget.cs : Implemented all the bool, string, and int props.

2001-10-04  Mike Kestner <mkestner@speakeasy.net>

	* gdk/SimpleEvent.cs : Temporarily uncomment the GCHandle code until
	a layout is ready and exceptions can be avoided.
	* gtk/Widget.cs : Killed all the signal and event attaching methods. 
	They never belonged here, and now they exist in the SimpleEvent.
	Add a Signals hash to hold refs of the Signal handlers. Killed default
	ctor and the dtor.  The event Add/Remove methods now create a 
	SimpleEvent, stuff it in the hash, and remove it when the last handler
	disappears.

2001-10-04  Mike Kestner <mkestner@speakeasy.net>

	* HACKING : Little bit of cleanup.
	* gdk/SimpleEvent.cs : Redesigned a bit. Docs.  Replaced refcounting 
	mechanism with an instance hash and added ctor/dtor.  This class
	now completely encapsulates the signal attachment and forwarding 
	mechanism for GdkEvent based signals.  It attaches to the raw signal, 
	maintains a ref to the associated event handler, and uses the static 
	callback to activate the event handler on signal receipt.
	* sample/makefile : killed one last CSC explicit reference. 

2001-10-02  Mike Kestner <mkestner@speakeasy.net>

	* glib/Value.cs : Tried adding CallingConvention.Cdecl to all the
	DllImports, but still couldn't get reliable Propery setting without
	periodic NullReference exceptions.  When all else fails, drop back 
	and punt.
	* glib/Object.cs : Rewrote Set|GetProperty methods.  Now they use
	g_object_get|set and don't rely on GValues. The int, bool, and string 
	prop types are now working reliably.
	* gtk/Window.cs : Update all Properties to use new GLib.Object
	signatures.
	* sample/HelloWorld.cs : added some more property usage for testing
	purposes.

2001-09-29  Mike Kestner <mkestner@speakeasy.net>

	* glib/Value.cs (int ctor): New constructor for int-based values.
	(int exp cast): New explicit cast operator for Val to int conversion.
	* gtk/Window.cs (DefaultHeight): New prop.
	(DefaultWidth): New prop.

2001-09-28  Mike Kestner <mkestner@speakeasy.net>

	* glib/Object.cs (GetProperty): New, gets props from the raw obj.
	(SetProperty): New, for setting props on the raw obj.
	* glib/Value.cs (type ctor): New needed for get accessors.
	*gtk/Window.cs (AllowGrow): Uncommented and filled out.
	(AllowShrink): Uncommented and filled out.
	(DestroyWithParent): Uncommented and filled out.
	(Modal): Uncommented and filled out.
	(Resizable): Added. All the bool Props work now.

2001-09-28  Mike Kestner <mkestner@speakeasy.net>

	* glib/Value.cs (~Value): New destructor to release g_malloc'd space.
	(default ctor): New default ctor just mallocs without init.
	(String ctor): call default
	(bool ctor): call default
	(Init): New post construct initializer.
	(String exp cast): Replaces ToString method.
	(bool exp cast): New for bool extraction.
	(MarshalAs): Renamed prop was RawValue.

2001-09-27  Mike Kestner <mkestner@speakeasy.net>

	* glib/Object.cs : Docs for everything. Made Objects hash private.
	Some coding style cleanup.  Pruned some of the TODO methods from the
	commented header listing to make a more relistic picture of the 
	remaining effort. Some GSignal stuff probly belongs here too.
	([Get|Set]Data): Killed some DllImports and set up methods to store
	arbitrary data in a managed hash table.
	
2001-09-27  Mike Kestner <mkestner@speakeasy.net>

	*.cs : Added .dll extension to a load of DllImports.
	* makefile : now can make the project with one make windows and on
	both NT and Win98.
	* gdk/Event.cs : Fixed some invalid symbol names and commented out a 
	load of stuff.
	* gdk/SimpleEvent.cs : Relocated file from unnecessary subdir and fixed
	several event keyword clashing bugs. Need to relocate the EventArgs
	class out of here into its own file. Fixed loads of typos.
	* glib/Object.cs : Killed the Constructor, this should be a purely
	abstract class. made Events property public until I can fix the Signal 
	proxying system's broken reliance on it.
	* glib/SimpleSignal.cs : Relocated, namespaces, and named this Class.
	Loads of bugfixes. Still doesn't work worth a damn, but it builds.
	* glib/TypeFundamentals.cs : New enum for use in the Value code.
	* glib/Value.cs : Implemented a more opaque approach with heap allocated
	memory and g_value_init and friends.  Still doesn't work.  Will probably
	switch to a more C# like approach and avoid GValues altogether.
	* gtk/Button.cs : Commented out some brokeness until I can get around
	to fixing it later.
	* gtk/Widget.cs : Commented out a bunch of the new signal stuff until
	I get around to it.
	* gtk/Window.cs (Title): using g_object_set until I work out the 
	details of the new Value/SetProperty system.  It looks like g_object_set
	will end up being easier to use via PInvoke.
	
2001-09-25  Bob Smith  <bob@thestuff.net>

	* Added refcounts to delegates to make sure they can be unpined when
	not needed.

2001-09-21  Bob Smith  <bob@thestuff.net>

	* Signal system totally reworked. It should be stable now.
	* glib/Object.cs: Rewrote the way the wrapper is kept track of.

2001-09-20  Bob Smith  <bob@thestuff.net>

	* glib/ObjectManager.cs: Nuked.
	* glib/Object.cs: Keep track of wrapper.
	* gtk/Object: First stab at better signal system. Should reduce
	number of pins nessisary.

2001-09-19  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@speakeasy.net>

	* HACKING : New rulez.
	* NOTES: Killed.  We have a mailing list now for this kind of stuff.
	* glib/makefile : New, to build the new glib-sharp.dll target.
	* glib/Object.cs : (GetObject): Commented out. Design problems here.
	IntPtr's can't be used in the manner this code attempts to use them.  
	(Data prop): Commented out.  Apparently keyed properties are not 
	supported.  
	(Object prop): Renamed RawObject, and made it protected.
	(Events): Fixed to cause list to be initialized if null and then 
	return the list.
	* glib/ObjectManager.cs : commented out entirely.  Not sure what this
	code is trying to accomplish and it doesn't compile.
	* glib/Value.cs : New attempt at implementing GValues. Doesn't work 
	yet.
	* gtk/Button.cs : Updated to use RawObject.  
	(Clicked event): s/EmitDeleteEvent/EmitClickedEvent.
	(Button(String)): s/gtk_label_new_with_lable/gtk_button_new_with_label.
	* gtk/Label.cs : Fixed some yank and paste errors where 2 value params
	were getting passed to all the set_* property methods.
	* gtk/Window.cs : Fixed hanging GTK namespace ref.
	* sample/HelloWorld.cs : Fixed hanging GTK namespace ref.


2001-09-18  Bob Smith  <bob@thestuff.net>

	* glib/Object.cs : Moved parts of gtk/Object.cs here, and added 
	static GetObject method and a Data property.
	* glib/ObjectManager.cs : New.
	* gtk/Object.cs : removed some GObject wrapping code.
	* gtk/*.cs : Updated namespace from GTK to Gtk.

2001-09-18  Bob Smith  <bob@thestuff.net>

	* gtk/Object.cs : Added EventList and Object properties.
	* gtk/Widget.cs : Updated event emission logic.
	* gtk/Window.cs : added Window(IntPtr) constructor.
	* gtk/Button.cs : New. Partial implementation of Button class.
	* gtk/Label.cs : New. Partial implementation of Label class.

2001-09-17  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@speakeasy.net>

	Initial Import. Partial implementation of Object, Widget, Window, 
	and Application classes and HelloWorld.cs sample app.
