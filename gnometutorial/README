This directory holds a tutorial telling developers everything they need, 
to start develop Gnome Applications with Mono and Gnome. 

This tutorial is born out of a vision of a first place to go for High Level Gnome desktop programming. 
The idea is to give application programmers an overview of the platform, 
information about available development tools and sample code. 

It was started by Martin Willemoes Hansen and he now is the maintainer

The tutorial can be viewed at: http://mwh.sysrq.dk/the_mono_tutorial/
It'll be updated from cvs regularily.
