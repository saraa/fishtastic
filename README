The Gtk# hompage can be found at gtk-sharp.sourceforge.net.

Gtk# is a C# binding for the Gtk toolkit (www.gtk.org).  The target is the
2.0 platform, and no plans are currently in place to backport to 1.2.

The effort essentially boils down to an exercise in PInvoke against the C
dynamic libraries.  It may end up being slow as hell, but we'll see when we get 
there and adjust accordingly.

The "Hello World" application in the sample directory has been executed
on Win32, but a recent version of Gtk is required. The binaries from the Gimp 
Win32 porting project were not compatible at last check.
