1. Some of the things you need (samples); can be re-used from the /sample
   directory in the gtk-sharp module. At least that is a start! :)

2. My suggestion is to make a small application that would show 
   programmers how to build a full application, pick a target application
   (for example you could pick the `same-gnome' game) and build it from
   zero:
   1.  Creating your UI using glade.
   2.  Connecting the Glade code to C#
   3.  Making the program go.
   4.  Using the Canvas/Drawing.
   5.  Creating a configuration dialog box with Glade.
   6.  Loading configuration settings from GConf.
   7.  Storing scores on a database.
   8.  Internationalization.
   9.  Adding an About Box and a logo
   10. Making the executable self-contained
   11. Creating a custom widget.
