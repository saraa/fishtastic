<h1>Eclipse for developing Mono applications</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>When you visit Eclipse's <a href="http://eclipse.org/">web page</a>, 
you may wonder what Eclipse is: some Java library, an IDE, just and editor? 
The answer is: all of the three.
The Eclipse Platform (as <a href="http://eclipse.org/whitepapers/eclipse-overview.pdf">
this</a> white paper states) is designed for building integrated development
environments (IDEs) that can be used to create applications as diverse as web
sites, embedded Java programs, C++ programs, and Enterprise JavaBeans.
What does it mean? That apart from initially having just an editor with
a few shortcuts for doing several common programming tasks easier, you can
extend the IDE to any language creating plug-ins that can run on any OS 
that Eclipse is ported to.</p>

<p>With the multi-language nature of Mono, this seems to be a very
important project for future development of applications in this
framework. But even now it can be a very helpful IDE for developing
C# applications. There is already a basic C# plug-in for Eclipse,
that although lacking some interesting features, implements
auto indenting and syntax highlighting for this language.
Another extra point is that Eclipse can use the Gtk2 toolkit
on GNU/Linux. This is great for Gnome users, as it adapts better
to the environment.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>First things first. You must get Eclipse from the 
<a href="http://eclipse.org/downloads/index.html">download</a> section.
Choose any release you want to download and you'll be presented
with different packages of the Eclipse platform. Unless you are planning 
to work in a plug-in for Eclipse, downloading the Platform Runtime Binary
for your OS will suffice (and will save you lots of bandwith).
Also remember that you will need a Java runtime environment (JRE),
that you can get following the instructions in the download page,
or from <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/">Sun</a>'s site.</p>

<p>The installation of the Eclipse platform is very quick and simple.
You just have to unzip the downloaded file in a directory, and from
there running the eclipse executable (you must have the JRE path
in your PATH environment variable).
The loading process is rather slow, but not slower than a few other
native applications out there.</P>

<p>Next you will want to install <a href="http://www.improve-technologies.com">
Improve</a>'s <a href="http://www.improve-technologies.com/alpha/esharp/">C# 
plug-in</a>. Follow the instructions on the plug-in site.</P>

<p>Optionally, if you plan to be working on C/C++ code any time, you can
download the C Development Environment from the 
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/tools/index.html">Tools Project</a>.
Just unzipping the plug-in on the Eclipse directory will suffice.</p>

<h2>Using Eclipse</h2>

<p>You can start a new C# project just by going to "File->New->Project"
and choosing 'Simple' on the dialog presented. Your newly created
project will appear at the Navigator on the left. You can now
start creating the layout of your project. You can do this by
using the context menu on the Navigator or by using the "File->New" menu.
To create a C# file you must use "New->C# File". The file will be filled
with a simple template of a C# program.</P>

<p>Let's say you want to import the newly created project to a CVS
repository you have access to. On the context menu
of the Navigator you have the "Team->Share Project" item. By clicking
on it you will get the chance to configure the CVS repository
settings, and then you will be presented with the Synchronize view
to see the files that will be added, and then you can choose which
ones to add to version control and which to ignore.</P>

<p>To check out a CVS module follow this procedure. Go to 
"Window->Open Perspective->CVS Repository Exploring", then right click on 
the "CVS Repositories" window and choose "New->Repository Location"
and fill in the dialog with your login settings.
You can then expand the CVS tree, right-click on a directory and
choose "Check Out As Project".</p>

<p>From now on you can experiment with the rest of the features.
You will be surprised at how stable and intuitive this application is.</p>
