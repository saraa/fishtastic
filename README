The Gtk# homepage can be found at gtk-sharp.sourceforge.net.

Gtk# is a C# binding for the Gtk+ toolkit (www.gtk.org).  The target is the
2.0 platform, and no plans are currently in place to backport to 1.2.

The effort essentially boils down to an exercise in PInvoke against the C
dynamic libraries.  It may end up being slow as hell, but we'll see when we get 
there and adjust accordingly.

Building Gtk#:
--------------
Currently, it is only possible to compile Gtk# on Win32 using the .Net 
framework compiler and libraries. The build system is in a transitional
state at the moment.  Windows compilation utilizes the cygwin environment 
for a GNU build environment. To compile the package type:

make -f makefile.win32

in the top level directory.

The linux build fails due to unresolved issues in mcs.  If you would like
to help work these issues, the build procedure on linux is the typical:

configure
make
make install

If you are compiling from CVS, you will need libtool and the auto* tools
and will need to replace the configure above with autogen.sh.
