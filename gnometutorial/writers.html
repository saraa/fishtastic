<h2>Ideas</h2>
<ol>
 <li>Some of the things you need (samples); can be re-used from the /sample
 directory in the gtk-sharp module. At least that is a start! :)
 <br>Richard Torkar
 <li>My suggestion is to make a small application that would show 
 programmers how to build a full application, pick a target application
 (for example you could pick the `same-gnome' game) and build it from
 zero:
 <ul>
  <li>Creating your UI using glade.
  <li>Connecting the Glade code to C#
  <li>Making the program go.
  <li>Using the Canvas/Drawing.
  <li>Creating a configuration dialog box with Glade.
  <li>Loading configuration settings from GConf.
  <li>Storing scores on a database.
  <li>Internationalization.
  <li>Adding an About Box and a logo
  <li>Making the executable self-contained
  <li>Creating a custom widget.
 </ul>
