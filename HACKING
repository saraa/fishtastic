Please please please hack on gtk-sharp.

Okay, now for the details.

Prior to checking anything into CVS, please send a patch to the mailing list
(gtk-sharp-list@ximian.com) for approval.  Any patches should be submitted in
diff -u format.  Also, it is assumed that the submitter has verified that the
patch does not break the build, and hopefully that it doesn't break runtime.

Second, patches without Documentation comments will be seriously frowned upon,
if not outright rejected.  All classes, methods, properties, events, etc...
that are non-private should be documented with XML comment tags.  At a minimum,
the summary and remarks tags, plus returns and params, if applicable.

Third, Make a ChangeLog entry.  Get credit for your hard work, and let me know
who I need to get cranky with at a glance, instead of having to do cvs history
reports.  :-)

Fourth, please please please hack on gtk-sharp.
