Before beginning work on something, please post your intentions to the 
mailing list (gtk-sharp-list@ximian.com).  Duplication of effort just gets
folks cranky in general.  

Prior to checking anything into CVS, please send a patch to the mailing list
for approval.  Any patches should be submitted in diff -u format.  Also, it is 
assumed that the submitter has verified that the patch does not break the 
build, and hopefully that it doesn't break runtime.

Patches without Documentation comments will be seriously frowned upon,
if not outright rejected.  All classes, methods, properties, events, etc...
that are non-private should be documented with XML comment tags.  At a minimum,
the summary and remarks tags, plus returns and params, if applicable. Doing 
this as we go is the only feasible way to make sure that our docs won't end
up sucking bigtime.
