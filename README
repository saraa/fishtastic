The Gtk# homepage can be found at gtk-sharp.sourceforge.net.

Gtk# is a C# binding for the Gtk+ toolkit (www.gtk.org).  The target is the
2.0 platform, and no plans are currently in place to backport to 1.2.

The effort essentially boils down to an exercise in PInvoke against the C
dynamic libraries.  It may end up being slow as hell, but we'll see when we get 
there and adjust accordingly.

Building Gtk#:
--------------
Currently, it is only possible to compile Gtk# on Win32 using the .Net 
framework compiler and libraries. Miguel and company will be changing that
shortly. The win32 compilation utilizes the cygwin environment for a GNU
build environment.

You will also need a a recent copy of the gtkapi.xml file.  Tarballs containing 
this file can be downloaded from the Sourceforge gtk-sharp project page. Extract
the tar.gz file into the generator directory and then type:

make windows

in the top level directory.

Discussion:
-----------
A mailing list for Gtk# discussion (gtk-sharp-list@ximian.com) is available.
Subscription and archives are available at lists.ximian.com. The list
requires subscription in order to post.
