2001-09-28  Mike Kestner <mkestner@speakeasy.net>

	* glib/Value.cs (~Value): New destructor to release g_malloc'd space.
	(default ctor): New default ctor just mallocs without init.

2001-09-27  Mike Kestner <mkestner@speakeasy.net>

	* glib/Object.cs : Docs for everything. Made Objects hash private.
	Some coding style cleanup.  Pruned some of the TODO methods from the
	commented header listing to make a more relistic picture of the 
	remaining effort. Some GSignal stuff probly belongs here too.
	([Get|Set]Data): Killed some DllImports and set up methods to store
	arbitrary data in a managed hash table.

	*.cs : Added .dll extension to a load of DllImports.
	* makefile : now can make the project with one make windows and on
	both NT and Win98.
	* gdk/Event.cs : Fixed some invalid symbol names and commented out a 
	load of stuff.
	* gdk/SimpleEvent.cs : Relocated file from unnecessary subdir and fixed
	several event keyword clashing bugs. Need to relocate the EventArgs
	class out of here into its own file. Fixed loads of typos.
	* glib/Object.cs : Killed the Constructor, this should be a purely
	abstract class. made Events property public until I can fix the Signal 
	proxying system's broken reliance on it.
	* glib/SimpleSignal.cs : Relocated, namespaces, and named this Class.
	Loads of bugfixes. Still doesn't work worth a damn, but it builds.
	* glib/TypeFundamentals.cs : New enum for use in the Value code.
	* glib/Value.cs : Implemented a more opaque approach with heap allocated
	memory and g_value_init and friends.  Still doesn't work.  Will probably
	switch to a more C# like approach and avoid GValues altogether.
	* gtk/Button.cs : Commented out some brokeness until I can get around
	to fixing it later.
	* gtk/Widget.cs : Commented out a bunch of the new signal stuff until
	I get around to it.
	* gtk/Window.cs (Title): using g_object_set until I work out the 
	details of the new Value/SetProperty system.  It looks like g_object_set
	will end up being easier to use via PInvoke.

	* Added refcounts to delegates to make sure they can be unpined when
	not needed.

2001-09-21  Bob Smith  <bob@thestuff.net>

	* Signal system totally reworked. It should be stable now.
	* glib/Object.cs: Rewrote the way the wrapper is kept track of.

2001-09-20  Bob Smith  <bob@thestuff.net>

	* glib/ObjectManager.cs: Nuked.
	* glib/Object.cs: Keep track of wrapper.
	* gtk/Object: First stab at better signal system. Should reduce
	number of pins nessisary.

2001-09-19  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@speakeasy.net>

	* HACKING : New rulez.
	* NOTES: Killed.  We have a mailing list now for this kind of stuff.
	* glib/makefile : New, to build the new glib-sharp.dll target.
	* glib/Object.cs : (GetObject): Commented out. Design problems here.
	IntPtr's can't be used in the manner this code attempts to use them.  
	(Data prop): Commented out.  Apparently keyed properties are not 
	supported.  
	(Object prop): Renamed RawObject, and made it protected.
	(Events): Fixed to cause list to be initialized if null and then 
	return the list.
	* glib/ObjectManager.cs : commented out entirely.  Not sure what this
	code is trying to accomplish and it doesn't compile.
	* glib/Value.cs : New attempt at implementing GValues. Doesn't work 
	yet.
	* gtk/Button.cs : Updated to use RawObject.  
	(Clicked event): s/EmitDeleteEvent/EmitClickedEvent.
	(Button(String)): s/gtk_label_new_with_lable/gtk_button_new_with_label.
	* gtk/Label.cs : Fixed some yank and paste errors where 2 value params
	were getting passed to all the set_* property methods.
	* gtk/Window.cs : Fixed hanging GTK namespace ref.
	* sample/HelloWorld.cs : Fixed hanging GTK namespace ref.
