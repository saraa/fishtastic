	* gtk/Button.cs : Implemented 3 constructors, 5 methods, 4 properties,
	and 6 signals.  Button API is 100% implemented.  Need to implement
	some Container methods to be able to complete testing.

2001-10-05  Mike Kestner <mkestner@speakeasy.net>

	* defs-parse.pl : A little automation for the binding.  The enums and 
	flags can be painlessly generated from defs files. 
	* gtk/makefile : use defs-parse.pl to produce generated.cs.
	* gtk/.cvsignore : hush generated.cs
	* gtk/gtk.defs : unceremoniously ripped from gtk+ HEAD.
	* gtk/Window.cs : Killed the WindowType enum which is now generated.
	
2001-10-04  Mike Kestner <mkestner@speakeasy.net>

	* glib/SimpleSignal.cs : Reworked to parallel SimpleEvent.

2001-10-04  Mike Kestner <mkestner@speakeasy.net>

	* gtk/Widget.cs : Implemented all the bool, string, and int props.

2001-10-04  Mike Kestner <mkestner@speakeasy.net>

	* gdk/SimpleEvent.cs : Temporarily uncomment the GCHandle code until
	a layout is ready and exceptions can be avoided.
	* gtk/Widget.cs : Killed all the signal and event attaching methods. 
	They never belonged here, and now they exist in the SimpleEvent.
	Add a Signals hash to hold refs of the Signal handlers. Killed default
	ctor and the dtor.  The event Add/Remove methods now create a 
	SimpleEvent, stuff it in the hash, and remove it when the last handler
	disappears.

2001-10-04  Mike Kestner <mkestner@speakeasy.net>

	* HACKING : Little bit of cleanup.
	* gdk/SimpleEvent.cs : Redesigned a bit. Docs.  Replaced refcounting 
	mechanism with an instance hash and added ctor/dtor.  This class
	now completely encapsulates the signal attachment and forwarding 
	mechanism for GdkEvent based signals.  It attaches to the raw signal, 
	maintains a ref to the associated event handler, and uses the static 
	callback to activate the event handler on signal receipt.
	* sample/makefile : killed one last CSC explicit reference. 

2001-10-02  Mike Kestner <mkestner@speakeasy.net>

	* glib/Value.cs : Tried adding CallingConvention.Cdecl to all the
	DllImports, but still couldn't get reliable Propery setting without
	periodic NullReference exceptions.  When all else fails, drop back 
	and punt.
	* glib/Object.cs : Rewrote Set|GetProperty methods.  Now they use
	g_object_get|set and don't rely on GValues. The int, bool, and string 
	prop types are now working reliably.
	* gtk/Window.cs : Update all Properties to use new GLib.Object
	signatures.
	* sample/HelloWorld.cs : added some more property usage for testing
	purposes.

2001-09-29  Mike Kestner <mkestner@speakeasy.net>

	* glib/Value.cs (int ctor): New constructor for int-based values.
	(int exp cast): New explicit cast operator for Val to int conversion.
	* gtk/Window.cs (DefaultHeight): New prop.
	(DefaultWidth): New prop.

2001-09-28  Mike Kestner <mkestner@speakeasy.net>

	* glib/Object.cs (GetProperty): New, gets props from the raw obj.
	(SetProperty): New, for setting props on the raw obj.
	* glib/Value.cs (type ctor): New needed for get accessors.
	*gtk/Window.cs (AllowGrow): Uncommented and filled out.
	(AllowShrink): Uncommented and filled out.
	(DestroyWithParent): Uncommented and filled out.
	(Modal): Uncommented and filled out.
	(Resizable): Added. All the bool Props work now.

2001-09-28  Mike Kestner <mkestner@speakeasy.net>

	* glib/Value.cs (~Value): New destructor to release g_malloc'd space.
	(default ctor): New default ctor just mallocs without init.
	(String ctor): call default
	(bool ctor): call default
	(Init): New post construct initializer.
	(String exp cast): Replaces ToString method.
	(bool exp cast): New for bool extraction.
	(MarshalAs): Renamed prop was RawValue.

2001-09-27  Mike Kestner <mkestner@speakeasy.net>

	* glib/Object.cs : Docs for everything. Made Objects hash private.
	Some coding style cleanup.  Pruned some of the TODO methods from the
	commented header listing to make a more relistic picture of the 
	remaining effort. Some GSignal stuff probly belongs here too.
	([Get|Set]Data): Killed some DllImports and set up methods to store
	arbitrary data in a managed hash table.
	
2001-09-27  Mike Kestner <mkestner@speakeasy.net>

	*.cs : Added .dll extension to a load of DllImports.
	* makefile : now can make the project with one make windows and on
	both NT and Win98.
	* gdk/Event.cs : Fixed some invalid symbol names and commented out a 
	load of stuff.
	* gdk/SimpleEvent.cs : Relocated file from unnecessary subdir and fixed
	several event keyword clashing bugs. Need to relocate the EventArgs
	class out of here into its own file. Fixed loads of typos.
	* glib/Object.cs : Killed the Constructor, this should be a purely
	abstract class. made Events property public until I can fix the Signal 
	proxying system's broken reliance on it.
	* glib/SimpleSignal.cs : Relocated, namespaces, and named this Class.
	Loads of bugfixes. Still doesn't work worth a damn, but it builds.
	* glib/TypeFundamentals.cs : New enum for use in the Value code.
	* glib/Value.cs : Implemented a more opaque approach with heap allocated
	memory and g_value_init and friends.  Still doesn't work.  Will probably
	switch to a more C# like approach and avoid GValues altogether.
	* gtk/Button.cs : Commented out some brokeness until I can get around
	to fixing it later.
	* gtk/Widget.cs : Commented out a bunch of the new signal stuff until
	I get around to it.
	* gtk/Window.cs (Title): using g_object_set until I work out the 
	details of the new Value/SetProperty system.  It looks like g_object_set
	will end up being easier to use via PInvoke.
	
2001-09-25  Bob Smith  <bob@thestuff.net>

	* Added refcounts to delegates to make sure they can be unpined when
	not needed.

2001-09-21  Bob Smith  <bob@thestuff.net>

	* Signal system totally reworked. It should be stable now.
	* glib/Object.cs: Rewrote the way the wrapper is kept track of.

2001-09-20  Bob Smith  <bob@thestuff.net>

	* glib/ObjectManager.cs: Nuked.
	* glib/Object.cs: Keep track of wrapper.
	* gtk/Object: First stab at better signal system. Should reduce
	number of pins nessisary.

2001-09-19  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@speakeasy.net>

	* HACKING : New rulez.
	* NOTES: Killed.  We have a mailing list now for this kind of stuff.
	* glib/makefile : New, to build the new glib-sharp.dll target.
	* glib/Object.cs : (GetObject): Commented out. Design problems here.
	IntPtr's can't be used in the manner this code attempts to use them.  
	(Data prop): Commented out.  Apparently keyed properties are not 
	supported.  
	(Object prop): Renamed RawObject, and made it protected.
	(Events): Fixed to cause list to be initialized if null and then 
	return the list.
	* glib/ObjectManager.cs : commented out entirely.  Not sure what this
	code is trying to accomplish and it doesn't compile.
	* glib/Value.cs : New attempt at implementing GValues. Doesn't work 
	yet.
	* gtk/Button.cs : Updated to use RawObject.  
	(Clicked event): s/EmitDeleteEvent/EmitClickedEvent.
	(Button(String)): s/gtk_label_new_with_lable/gtk_button_new_with_label.
	* gtk/Label.cs : Fixed some yank and paste errors where 2 value params
	were getting passed to all the set_* property methods.
	* gtk/Window.cs : Fixed hanging GTK namespace ref.
	* sample/HelloWorld.cs : Fixed hanging GTK namespace ref.


2001-09-18  Bob Smith  <bob@thestuff.net>

	* glib/Object.cs : Moved parts of gtk/Object.cs here, and added 
	static GetObject method and a Data property.
	* glib/ObjectManager.cs : New.
	* gtk/Object.cs : removed some GObject wrapping code.
	* gtk/*.cs : Updated namespace from GTK to Gtk.

2001-09-18  Bob Smith  <bob@thestuff.net>

	* gtk/Object.cs : Added EventList and Object properties.
	* gtk/Widget.cs : Updated event emission logic.
	* gtk/Window.cs : added Window(IntPtr) constructor.
	* gtk/Button.cs : New. Partial implementation of Button class.
	* gtk/Label.cs : New. Partial implementation of Label class.

2001-09-17  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@speakeasy.net>

	Initial Import. Partial implementation of Object, Widget, Window, 
	and Application classes and HelloWorld.cs sample app.
