	    The state member is set to the state of the window's
	    visibility and can be VisibilityUnobscured,
	    VisibilityPartiallyObscured, or VisibilityFullyObscured.
	    The X server ignores all of a window's subwindows when

          <para>
	    When the window changes state from partially obscured, fully
            obscured, or not viewable to viewable and completely unobscured,
            the X server generates the event with the state member of the
            EventVisibility structure set to Gdk.Visibility.Unobscured.
